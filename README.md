# ATtiny85-Motor

These are all the files That I used to make a ATtiny85 circuit that controls a motor's speed using a potentiometer, and also has indicator LEDs to qualitatively show the speed as you turn the potentiometer.

One thing to note is that for some reason the footprint for the diode D1 is backwards in KiCAD so when I first tried building this circuit the transistor would get very hot and after reversing the diode, the circuit worked properly.

I made a short youtube video to demonstrate this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHjCyNegOxA
